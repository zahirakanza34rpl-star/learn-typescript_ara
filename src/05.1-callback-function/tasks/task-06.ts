/**
 * A company has employee salary data below.
 * The HR department wants to process the same employee data using different rules.
 * For example:
 * - Calculate final salary.
 * - Determine bonus eligibility.
 * - Generate employee performance status.
 *
 * Bonus rules:
 * - Performance ≥ 90 → 15% of salary and status is "Exceeds Expectations"
 * - Performance ≥ 80 → 10% of salary and status is "Meets Expectations"
 * - Performance ≥ 70 → 5% of salary and status is "Needs Improvement"
 * - Below 70 → no bonus and status is "Unsatisfactory"
 *
 * TASK:
 * Create a reusable function that accepts:
 * - employee array
 * - callback function
 *
 * The callback should determine what operation is performed on each employee.
 * Students should create at least three callbacks below.
 * The processing function should not contain the HR business rules.
