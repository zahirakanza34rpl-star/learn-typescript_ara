/**
 * A company wants to create an employee salary management system.
 * Each employee has:
 * - Employee ID
 * - Name
 * - Position
 * - Basic salary
 * - Performance bonus
 * 
 * for example:
 * | Property     | Value            |
 * | ------------ | ---------------- |
 * | Employee ID  | EMP001           |
 * | Name         | Kevin De Bruyne  |
 * | Position     | Senior Developer |
 * | Basic Salary | Rp12,000,000     |
 * | Bonus        | Rp2,000,000      |
 * 
 * The company does not want employees or other parts of the application to directly modify their salary.
 * Student Tasks
 * - Create class Employee
 * - Use private properties for sensitive data such as:
 *   * private basicSalary: number;
 *   * private bonus: number;
 * - Create methods:
 *   * getBasicSalary()
 *   * setBasicSalary()
 *   * addBonus()
 *   * getTotalSalary()
 *   * showProfile()
 * - Business Rules
 *   * setBasicSalary():
 *     - Salary cannot be negative.
 *     - Salary must be greater than 0.
 *   * addBonus():
 *     - Bonus cannot be negative.
 *   * getTotalSalary():
 *     - basicSalary + bonus
 * - Implement class with object
