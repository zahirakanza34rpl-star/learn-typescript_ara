 * - Stock quantity
 * For example:
 * Product
 * - ID: PRD001
 * - Name: Gaming Laptop
 * - Price: Rp15,000,000

 * The company wants to make sure product data cannot be changed carelessly.
 * 
 * The system needs to support:
 * - Increasing stock
 * - Decreasing stock
 * - Changing price
 * - Checking stock availability
 * - Calculating inventory value
 * 
 * Student Tasks
 * - Create class Product
 * - Private Properties, at minimum:
 *   * private price: number;
 *   * private stock: number;
 * 
 * - Other properties can be public or private depending on the student's design.
 * - Required Methods
 *   * addStock(quantity)
 *   * removeStock(quantity)
 *   * changePrice(newPrice)
 *   * isAvailable()
